# CalcEngine

CalcEngine is a Java-based console application designed to perform basic arithmetic calculations. This project is a foundational implementation showcasing key programming concepts such as object-oriented design, exception handling, and modular code structure. The project is suitable for anyone looking to understand or build upon a simple calculation engine in Java.

---

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Modular Design:** Implements a clean and extendable architecture to add more operations in the future.
- **User Interaction:** Accepts user input via the console to perform calculations dynamically.
- **Error Handling:** Handles invalid input and division by zero gracefully.

---

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
- **IDE/Text Editor:** Any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor with Java support.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aniso13/CalcEngine.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CalcEngine
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or compile the Java files using the terminal.

### Running the Application
1. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
2. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
3. Follow the prompts in the console to input operations and numbers.

---

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter an operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).
3. Enter the required numbers when prompted.
4. View the calculated result displayed in the console.

---

## Example
**Input:**
```
Operation: add
First Number: 10
Second Number: 20
```
**Output:**
```
Result: 30
```

---

## Project Structure
- **Main.java:** Entry point of the application, manages user input and output.
- **Calculator.java:** Core logic for performing arithmetic operations.
- **Operation Interface:** Defines the blueprint for supported operations.
- **Custom Exceptions:** Handles invalid operations or edge cases like division by zero.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for advanced operations such as exponentiation, square roots, and trigonometric functions.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for an enhanced user experience.
- Integrate with external libraries for extended functionality (e.g., scientific calculations).
